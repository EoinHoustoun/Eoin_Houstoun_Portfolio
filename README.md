### Fever Prediction & Classification with Infrared Thermography
Developed regression and classification models to estimate oral temperature and fever status (â‰¥ 37.5â€¯Â°C) using non-contact thermal sensor data.
- Applied nested cross-validation and built custom PyTorch MLPs, outperforming XGBoost; SHAP used for feature explainability
